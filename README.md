# IDO-FLU
The Influenza Ontology (an extension of IDO Core)

Developed by Richard Scheuermann, Lynn Schriml, Joane Luciano, Melanie Courtot, Burke Squires, Meredith Kebyl and Lindsay Cowell (among others), IDOFLU covers the natural, experimental and clinical realms related to influenza virus life cycle, infection and disease. IDOFLU utilizes OBI classes for components of materials, qualities, and processes to map influenza virus sequence and surveillance terms to their corresponding materials and qualities. IDOFLU is applied to data collected by the Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) project to help researchers more easily elucidate influenza virulence and pathogenesis etiology.

IDOFLU is currently in the process of being updated and reengineered as an extension of the Virus Infectious Disease Ontology by Shane Babcock, in consultation with Burke Squires and Melanie Courtot.

IDO-FLU has been applied to databases such as the Influenza Research Database: https://www.fludb.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=influenza
as well as the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=vipr
